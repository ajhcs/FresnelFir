# Final Triage (`v0.1.0`)
Triage Window: 2026-02-17
Owner: Engineering (`ajhcs`)

## Objective
Resolve all `critical`/`high` findings before GA and explicitly disposition remaining items.

## Findings
| ID | Source | Severity | Decision | Owner | Retest Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-001 | CI security gates (`cargo-audit`, `cargo-deny`) | high | Fixed by upgrading `wasmtime` to `41.0.3` and re-running CI. | Engineering | `https://github.com/ajhcs/FresnelFir/actions/runs/22118771571` | CLOSED |
| F-002 | Release workflow installer verification | high | Fixed by replacing placeholders with real installer scripts and validation steps. | Engineering | `https://github.com/ajhcs/FresnelFir/actions/runs/22118456603` | CLOSED |
| F-003 | Final user validation not yet executed | high (process gate) | User validation complete. G4 sweep on `master`: `release-smoke.ps1 -SkipSecurity` 281/281 tests, `mcp_tests` 15/15, `traversal_tests` 12/12, `integration_tests` 4/4. G2 fresh-clone (`FresnelFir-fresh`): `cargo test --workspace --locked` 281/281 on MINGW64/Windows. Tested by `ajhcs` + Claude (Chief Engineer) on 2026-02-17. | Engineering + User | `docs/release/rc2-evidence.md`, `docs/release/release-checklist.md` | CLOSED |

## Decision Log
- Record severity changes with rationale.
- Record any approved freeze exceptions.
- Record why deferred items are safe for `v0.1.0`.

## Exit Criteria
- No unresolved `critical` or `high` findings.
- Deferred `medium`/`low` findings copied to `docs/release/known-issues.md` with mitigation and owner.
- `docs/release/rc2-evidence.md` updated with final gate status.
